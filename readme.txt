Welcome,


This is My Python Code Repo.

Will be Posting code and programs that I have made on my own time, most of them for fun and learning experience.

Some of the code I post are files that I coded that I want to look back on to help me get ready for interviews.

So you will see some stacks, and hash files, those are just files I'm using to drill these concepts into myself.


Please also check my Java repo.

Looking forward to a Great Career as a Software Engineer.

:)

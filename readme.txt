Welcome,


This is My Python Code.
I am nearing the end of BS degree at CUNY.

Getting ready for interviews and the real-world by going over important concepts in my two favorite languages. 
Using GitHub to track my progress and to make sure I try to commit everyday.

This way, I hope, I drill into myself important concepts, especially things like Algo and Data Structures.

Please also check my Java repo.

Looking forward to a great Career as a Software Engineer.
